Your initial residency classification will be determined when your admissions application is reviewed. Your official letter of acceptance will include your classification. If you are classified as a non-resident but meet the requirements for a policy or exception for resident status, you may apply to change your status. The resources listed above describe the various ways in which you may be eligible for in-state (resident) tuition under the provisions of Utah state law. These documents explain the general rule of the law and exceptions that may allow you to waive the time requirement and apply for residency immediately. Review these materials carefully. Non-residents eligible for reclassification must submit a complete reclassification, certification, or military form by the applicable term deadline with all required supporting documentation. Per University of Utah policy, incoming graduate students, including those in Law programs, may apply under the Undergraduate policy or any other policy if they qualify prior to the start of their graduate studies. Graduate students who begin their graduate program as a non-resident are only eligible to reclassify under the Graduate policy, which includes completing 40 graduate-level semester hours prior to reclassification. Medical students are held to the School of Medicine policies. Law students are ineligible to reclassify after beginning their program. Dental students admitted as non-residents are ineligible for reclassification at any time. The only exceptions to Graduate, Medical, Law, and Dental residency policy are for students proving eligibility through military or American Indian exceptions, or the House Bill 144 tuition waiver as described below.
